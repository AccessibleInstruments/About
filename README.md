Everyone with an interest in the subject is welcome to join - whether you have any experience or not :sparkles: :two_hearts:

## What are we doing?

We :heart: music and believe that everyone - no matter their ability - should be able to experience playing music. 

We plan to use this space to share resources, start projects and collaborate together in making digital music tools more accessible.

We also have the Modern Music Creation Accessibility Group as a google mailing list for anyone interested in joining the conversation, [you can do so here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mmc-accessibility-group).
